    "# Monitor and Analyze Training Jobs Using Metrics\n",
    "An Amazon SageMaker training job is an iterative process that teaches a model to make predictions by presenting examples from a training dataset.  \n",
    "Typically, a training algorithm computes several metrics, such as training error and prediction accuracy. These metrics help diagnose whether the model is learning well and will generalize well for making predictions on unseen data.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The training algorithm writes the values of these metrics to logs, which Amazon SageMaker monitors and sends to Amazon CloudWatch in real time.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want Amazon SageMaker to parse logs from a custom algorithm and send metrics that the algorithm emits to CloudWatch, you have to specify the metrics that you want Amazon SageMaker to send to CloudWatch when you configure the training job.  \n",
    "You specify the name of the metrics that you want to send and the regular expressions that Amazon SageMaker uses to parse the logs that your algorithm emits to find those metrics."
